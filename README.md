## Overview

This project is a digital version of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. The user plays against the computer, which randomly selects one of the three options. The game's outcome (win, lose, or draw) is then displayed to the user.

## Features

- User-friendly interface.
- Responsive design.
- Interactive gameplay with immediate feedback.
- Randomized computer choices.
- Score tracking for both the player and the computer.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout of the game interface.
- **JavaScript:** Game logic and interactivity.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **HTML:** Creating the structure of a web page and understanding semantic tags.
- **CSS:** Styling web pages, including layout techniques and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Implementing game logic, handling user input, and updating the DOM dynamically.
